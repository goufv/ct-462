# CT 462 Service Listing

## Description

Project description
As part of a reorganization of the Current Students/Student Support/Student Experience area of the website, we are upgrading the  https://ufv.ca/studentservices/ page. 
We would like one page that lists all available UFV services, that allows students to filter and search based on needs & interests.

What's the rationale for this project?

As part of our SEM goals, this will boosts UFV's ability to be a "student-ready university." This is also in line with CSI's recommendations around creating resources based on student needs/student journey.

Samples?

Here is the design mock-up with desired features:

Possible template to use https://canvastemplate.com/block-content-faqs-1.html 

Here is a basic example of just the expandable aspect: https://www.macewan.ca/campus-life/advising-support/ (We can do better!)

Here is another example of a more complex set of expendables: https://www.arts.ubc.ca/programs/program-options/ 

Desired completion date?
2024-06-14
